# Config-Space-register-block-implementation-with-AXI-lite-interface
Developed an AXI-Lite slave module with a configurable register block. Implemented an AXI-Lite interface handler and a register block with different access types (RW, RO, WO, RW1C) for read and write operations. Tested it using an AXI-Lite Master BFM.
